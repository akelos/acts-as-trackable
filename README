Acts as Trackable Plugin
===================================
This plugin allows you to track any kind of activity related to your object.

Tracking login activity into a backend:

define the act in your model:

class User extends ActiveRecord
{

    var $acts_as = array('trackable'=>array('login'=>
                                  array('action'=>'User "%user" logged into "%item" from IP "%subject"')));
                                  
    function get_tracking_description()
    {
        return $this->username;
    }
}

and start tracking:

$activity = $user->track('login','backoffice',$this->Request->getIp());

$activity->getDescription(); // User "administrator" logged into "backoffice" from IP "127.0.0.1"



Installation
--------------------------------

    ./script/plugin install acts_as_trackable

The Installer will add some new methods to the app/shared_model.php.
Please do not modify them, they are marked with

/** AUTOMATED START: &track */
function &track($activityName, &$item, $subject)
{
.....
}
/** AUTOMATED END: &track */


Defining trackable activities
----------------------------------

define as many activities as you like as follows:

var $acts_as = array('trackable'=>array('activity1','activity2',...,'activityN'));

Each activity can have configuration options:

$default_options = array('table_name'=>'activities', // table can be changed to separate activity storage !!! YOU need to create the table manually
                         'visibility'=>'public', // can be used to filter activities
                         'action'=>'%actor executed activity "%actionName" on %item',
                         'destroy'=>true); // if set to true, all activities will be destroyed if the actor is destroyed
                         

See test/unit/lib/ActsAsTrackable.php for usage info.
